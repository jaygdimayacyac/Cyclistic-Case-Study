# Cyclistic-Case-Study
## Google Data Analytics Career Certificate Capstone

### Background & Challenge
Cyclistic is a company based in Chicago that has provided bike-share services in the city since 2016. The director of marketing believes that the success of the company depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Financial analysts at the company have concluded that annual members are more profitable than casual members, so there is a push to convert casual members to annual members rather than target all-new customers.

### Scenario
As a hypothetical junior data analyst at the company, I am tasked with with identifying trends in the bike-share data to determine:
1. How casual riders and Cyclistic (annual) members use the bikes differently
2. Why casual riders would want to convert to annual memberships
3. How Cyclistic can use digital media to influence conversion of casual riders to Cyclistic (annual) members
